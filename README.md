# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor - Challenges to help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

This was the first Frontend Mentor project that I started, but not the first one I completed. Originally, I tried building this simple layout in a very much backwards way which caused some frustration. I dropped it for a couple of days, and moved on to work on other projects from the site. 
After that brief but productive break, I came back to this and decided to rebuild from scratch using the concepts I'd just learned and it worked out great! It's much better now and I'm happy that I was able to come back and refactor everything successfully. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
